# C# - Strongly Typed
- Value types
  - Occupy a single space in memory
  - Primitive types such as int, float, bool and char are value types
  - Efficient
- Reference types
  - Object is created in memory and then handled through a separate reference
  - Holds the memory address of a value, not the value itself

C# supports the following primitive types:
- bool
- byte
- sbyte
- char
- decimal
- double
- float
- int
- uint
- long
- ulong
- object
- short
- ushort
- string 

New value types can be created through extending System.ValueType
