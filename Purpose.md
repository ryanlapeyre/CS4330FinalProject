# C#
C# was released in 2000.  Essentially, Microsoft wanted to expand on the capabilities of Java and came up with the idea of C#.  Microsoft created C# with certain objectives in mind.  These include:
* C# is simple.
  * C# is based on C and C++, so the syntax of the language feels very similar.  C# eliminates some of the more complex concepts from these languages, such as multiple inheritance from C++.  C# also simplifies complex syntax, such as the '::', '->', '.' operators from C++ by replacing them with the '.' operator.  These changes are to make C# both simple and easy-to-use.
* C# is modern.
  * C# contains features expected of a modern, high-level programming language such as exception handling and garbage collection.  
* C# is object-oriented.
  * C# contains notions of abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.  These are all features expected of an object-oriented language.  

C# is Microsoft's Java.  Although very similar, the two languages have many differences as well.

# Ruby
Ruby was released in 1995.  Ruby is supposed to feel natural, simple, and balanced.  Ruby is object-oriented.  Everything within Ruby is an object, including primitive data types.  Ruby is flexible.  Essential parts of the language can be removed, modified, or extended at will.  Ruby is a powerful, high-level language.  Ruby features native garbage collection, exception handling, and independent threading.  This makes Ruby very powerful.  Ruby is also portable language.  Ruby runs on many different operating systems.
