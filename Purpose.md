# C#
Essentially, Microsoft wanted to expand on the capabilities of Java and came up with the idea of C#.  Microsoft created C# with certain objectives in mind.  These include:
* C# is simple.
  * C# is based on C and C++, so the syntax of the language feels very similar.  C# eliminates some of the more complex concepts from these languages, such as multiple inheritance from C++.  C# also simplifies complex syntax, such as the '::', '->', '.' operators from C++ by replacing them with the '.' operator.  These changes are
* C# is modern.
  * C# contains features expected of a modern, high-level programming language such as exception handling and garbage collection.  
* C# is object-oriented.
  * C# contains notions of abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.  These are all features expected of an object-oriented language.  

C# is Microsoft's Java.  Although very similar, the two languages have many differences as well.
