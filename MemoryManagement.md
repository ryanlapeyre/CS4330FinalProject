# C#
C# employs automatic memory management so that the developer does not need to worry about manually allocating and freeing space in memory. Automatic memory management policies are implemented by a garbage collector; these policies include decisions on where to allocate memory for a newly created object, when to relocate that memory, when to run destructors, and so forth.

# Ruby
Ruby also employs automatic memory management. Ruby has no concept of stack allocated variables; all variables, including local variables, live on the heap. Similarly to C#, Ruby has no way to explicitly free memory.

Ruby traditionally used a Mark and Sweep algorithm for garbage collection, which operates by traversing all living objects and marking them, followed by collecting the remaining unmarked objects. This method had sometimes caused significant overhead and has been replaced by generational and incremental garbage collection in more recent versions.
