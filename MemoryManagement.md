# C#
C# employs automatic memory management so that the developer does not need to worry about manually allocating and freeing space in memory. Automatic memory management policies are implemented by a garbage collector; these policies include decisions on where to allocate memory for a newly created object, when to relocate that memory, when to run destructors, and so forth.

# Ruby
Ruby also employs automatic memory managenet. Ruby has no concept of stack allocated variables; all variables, even local variables, live on the heap. Similarly to C#, Ruby has no way to explicitly free memory.
